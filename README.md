## layout-cakes

I designed this simple layout just for for practice. I was trying to make minimalistic, but effective; without tons of effects out of context.

Parallax and few scroll effects are in jQuery. And I used Sass of course.

It's all responsive, and looks great on mobile, so make sure to also try it out on your phone!

And yes, It's pink.
