## layout-cakes

I designed this simple layout, to practice CSS animations, shadows, transitions etc. I was trying to make it simple, but effective, just nice. And yes, It's pink.

Parallax and few scroll effects are in jQuery. And I used Sass of course. In the last section I purposely turned off hover effects for touch screens and used clicks instead.
It's all responsive, and looks great on mobile, so be sure to also try it out on your phone...
