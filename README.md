## layout-cakes

I designed this simple layout just for for practice. I was trying to make minimalistic, but effective; without tons of effects out of context. I'll definitely add at least one more section and a footer as soon as I find out something that fits the concept.

Parallax and few scroll effects are in jQuery. And I used Sass of course. In the last section I purposely turned off hover effects for touch screens and used clicks instead.
It's all responsive, and looks great on mobile, so make sure to also try it out on your phone!

And yes, It's pink.
